# React Native Socket.IO App with Express Backend

This repository contains a **React Native App** (built with Expo and NativeWind) and a simple **Express API** serving as the backend with **Socket.IO** integration. The app demonstrates how to connect to a Socket.IO server, display a list of rooms, join a room, and listen for real-time events.

## Features

### Backend (Express + Socket.IO):
- Serves a Socket.IO server.
- Manages real-time connections.
- Emits and listens for events within specific rooms.

### Frontend (React Native + Expo):
- Connects to the Socket.IO server.
- Displays 5 available rooms.
- Allows joining rooms and receiving real-time updates via events.
- Styled with **NativeWind** (Tailwind CSS for React Native).
